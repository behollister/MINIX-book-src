Troubleshooting guide for Partition Resizer
===========================================

This document will help you to solve the most common problems you will face
when you use Partition Resizer. It is divided in two sections, which contain
several topics on various subjects. I hope it will help you the most.

1- Before you run Partition Resizer

   1.1 Unmovable and system files
   1.2 Defragmenting your partition

2- While you run Partition Resizer

   2.1 Abnormal program interruption
   2.2 False interrupt warning
   2.3 Error and warning messages and what you can do about them

1- Before you run Partition Resizer

   1.1 Unmovable and system files

These files may sometimes need special care. This is how you should handle
the most common system files:

IO.SYS:         It doesn't have a problem with resizing or moving, but you 
                should not move it with defragmentation programs, otherwise
                the system won't boot.
MSDOS.SYS:      This file can be moved or defragmented as any ordinary file.
DBLSPACE.BIN:   This file can be moved or defragmented as any ordinary file.
STACVOL.*:      These files can be moved or defragmented as any ordinary file.
386SPART.PAR:   This file will be damaged if resized or moved. You'd better
                remove it before resizing or moving, and recreate it when
                you've finished.
MIRROR files:   These files can be moved or defragmented as any ordinary file.
		But they will be invalid when you change the partition, so
                you'll have to rerun mirror after Partition Resizer's 
                finished.

Most system files won't be damaged if they are moved. If the files have no
special position in the disk and they are fragmented, they can be moved or
defragmented as any ordinary file.


   1.2 Defragmenting your partition

In order to use Partition Resizer to shrink a partition, you'll have to 
defragment it first. This can be done with any defragmentation program that
performs a full optimization of the drive, like DOS 6.00 or later Defrag.
You will have to move ALL the files to the beginning of the partition 
(including unmovable files). To move unmovable files, use ATTRIB to change
their attributes (-s -h -r). See the previous section for details on system
files. After you've finished with defrag, you may change the attributes back
to normal.


2- While you run Partition Resizer

   2.1 Abnormal program interruption

If you have a power shutdown or any other abnormal termination of the program
while Partition Resizer resizes or moves a partition, then you MUST rerun
the program IMMEDIATELY after rebooting. This will continue the job from
exactly where it stopped. The program output to the screen will show that
the job started from the beginning, but nothing will be written on the disk
until the process reaches the step at which it was interrupted. Partition
Resizer will prompt you in this case, and you should answer yes when it asks
you to restore the interrupted work.

If the program hangs, and all you can do is reset your computer (most unlikely
but you never know), rerun the program, and the job will finish normally. The
same will


   2.2 False interrupt warning

There might be some cases that Partition Resizer will ask you to restore an
unfinished job, but you haven't had a program interrupt or anything like that.
In that case, Partition Resizer has found an older RESCUE.DAT file in the
current directory, which could not be deleted (for unknown reasons). You
should delete this file, but ONLY if you are sure that Partition Resizer has
finished its job successfully. To delete the file in this case, AND ONLY IF
you are absolutely sure that the alarm is false, use the /killrescue switch
(see PRESIZER.DOC for details). Beware!!! If you left Partition Resizer
unattended to modify a partition and when you returned the machine was already
rebooted, you should NOT delete the file, but run Partition Resizer again.
Partition Resizer WILL NEVER reboot the system without your interaction.

A possible reason for this false alarm, could be that you run the program from
a partition which was resized or moved. Although you shouldn't have done this,
and although this HAS caused damage to your data (it might have damaged the
FAT or some files), you MUST NOT ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO CONTINUE THE WORK
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. This will PERMANENTLY destroy all the data in your
partition.


   2.3 Error and warning messages and what you can do about them

Fatal error messages:

When a fatal error message appears, you will not be able to continue running
the program, unless the problem is fixed. The program will immediately exit
on a fatal message.

1:	No disks detected: If Partition Resizer cannot detect any hard drives
	through INT 0x13, it will exit. If you have a hard drive, then you
	probably need a driver to access it, which is not loaded.

Error messages:

When an error message appears, you will be able to use the program, but the
offending object (disk or partition) will not be available for processing.

1:	Disk read verification failed: Partition Resizer will try to read the
	first and the last sector on every disk. If it fails, it means that
	the drive is incompatible with the standard INT 0x13 read routine,
	therefore it is not reliable to work with it. The offending disk will
	be disabled.

2:      Sector size other than 512 bytes: Partition Resizer is incompatible
	with disks having sector size other than 512 bytes. If a disk is
	reported to have a sector size other than 512 bytes, the disk will
	be disabled. This error only occurs for LBA disks, which report the
        sector size. I have never heard of disks with sector size other than
        512, but one never knows... Note: Some BIOSs falsely report the
        sector size to be other than 512 bytes. If you are sure that sector
        size for your disk is definitely 512 bytes, then use the /ignsectsize
        switch to bypass this error.

3:	More than one extended partition exist: If more than one extended
	partitions exist on a disk, the disk will be disabled, since this
	violates the standard set for PC partition structures.

4:	System sector read failed: This error will appear when Partition
	Resizer is unable to read a system sector. This can happen if
	Partition Resizer is incompatible with the disk (I don't know if this
	can happen), if	the specified sector is damaged, or if disk
	information is erroneous. The offending disk will be disabled.

5:	Incompatible extended partition chain: This is a generic error that
	occurs when the partition chain is not compliant with the PC
	partition structure standard. The disk containing the offending
	partition structure will be disabled.

6:	System sector signature not found: This error will appear if some
	sectors in the partition structure do not have the 0xAA55 signature.
	The disk will be disabled, since, if the partition chain is really
	damaged, the program could crash.

7:	Overlapping partitions found: Two (or more) partitions are sharing
	the same disk space. This is a severe error and must be corrected to
	ensure data integrity. The offending disk will be disabled.

8:      FAT partition damaged or not formated: This error will appear if
	you have any partitions that are described as DOS partitions but
	are not formatted. It means that the program failed to find the
	system signature (0xAA55) at the end of a DOS partition's boot sector.
	If you're able to access all your partitions, then just add the
	signature byte (0xAA55) to the end of the specific partition's boot
	sector. The offending partition will be disabled.

9:	Partition extends outside disk limits: The offending partition's
	ending location is beyond disk's physical limits. This may occur
	if a partition is using LBA translation, but there is no evidence that
	the disk is using LBA translation as well. The offending partition
	will be disabled.

10:	CHS values are invalid: This error occurs only for non-LBA disks. If
	a partition's CHS values for starting and ending location do not agree
	with the reported drive's geometry, the partition will be disabled.

11:	Filesystem sector read failed: A system sector of a FAT drive cannot
	be read (probably a bad sector). The offending partition will be
	disabled.

12:	Filesystem size exceeds partition boundaries: The FAT drive size
	specified in the boot sector is larger than the size of the containing
	partition. This means that part of the drive's data may be allocating
	space outside the partition's boundaries. The disk will be disabled to
	protect these data.

Warning messages:

These warning messages appear when the partitions on your disk have some
erroneous or unexpected information, but it is safe to ignore them in most
cases if you can access the offending partitions normally and diagnostics
programs do not show any errors.

1:	Reported sector size other than 512 bytes: This warning occurs if the
	sector size value of a FAT drive's boot sector is other than 512. You
	should verify that your disk uses a sector size of 512 bytes,
	otherwise do not use Partition Resizer with the disk.

2:	CHS values do not match absolute start/size values: This error will
	occur if the dword entries for total sectors in partition or relative
	starting sector	values do not match the partition starting/ending
	CHS values. The error occurs in non-LBA disks only. This warning
	can usually be ignored, but you should check it out with a diagnostics
	tool.

3:      Bad filesystem id string / unknown filesystem type: This error will
	appear when a partition is described as a DOS partition but it doesn't
	have a valid FS signature. You may proceed if you encounter this
	warning.

4:  Filesystem id incorrect: The FS signature is different from the
	expected. You can safely proceed if you encounter this warning.

5:      False sectors per track / head value in boot sector: The boot sector
	contains erroneous information for disk heads and sectors per track.
	You can ignore this message.

6:      FAT signature bad or missing: The FAT signature is bad (not
	0x[FF]FFFFF8). You should check this error, it could mean your FAT
	is damaged. But Partition Resizer will allow you to continue, since
	its working will not be affected by this.

7:      Bad media descriptor: The media descriptor in the boot sector is
	wrong (not 0xF8). You can ignore this message.

8:      Hidden sectors value incorrect: This warning means that the hidden
	sectors value in the boot sector of a FAT partition is incorrect. If
	you are able to access your partitions normally, you should ignore
	this warning.

9:	FAT32 Mirroring disabled: If mirroring is disabled for a FAT32
	partition, there is a great chance that the partition's vital system
	area is physically damaged (bad sectors). Use a diagnostics tool to
	scan the drive's surface, and if no problems exist, you may safely
	proceed and ignore the warning. Make sure to allow Partition Resizer
	to perform a surface test when prompted.

All these error messages will show you some more information, which might help
you to correct the problem. The "drive" value is the number of the physical
drive (80 for 1st hard disk, 81 for 2nd and so on). The "sector" value is the
absolute zero-based sector number in the disk, where the erroneous information
appears. The "partition#" value, will tell you which partition contains the
error (numbering is the same as in PRESIZER.LOG). To find out more information
about the offending partition, locate the partition's data in PRESIZER.LOG.

All info about the technical details can be found in section 3 of
PRESIZER.DOC.


   2.4 Cmos operation failed

If you get a message informing you that you cannot use cmos memory for the
reset protection system, you will be able to run the program normally, but
you won't be able to recover after an abnormal program interrupt. This
means that the power goes down suddenly while the program is working, or if
it's interrupted in any other way, you will LOOSE ALL THE DATA IN THE WORKING
PARTITION! It's up to you then whether you will use the program or not. If
you have a UPS, you won't have a problem with this.


3- After you run Partition Resizer

   3.1 System will not boot

If your system does not boot from the hard disk after using Partition Resizer,
boot from a floppy disk and run "FDISK /MBR". This should fix the problem and
your system will now boot as normal (the above command does not affect your
system's integrity, and does not produce any output on screen).
