Known incompatibilities of Partition Resizer with other software
================================================================

Partition Resizer will behave unpredictably or undesirably in the following 
cases:

OS/2 & FAT Partitions:
        Partition Resizer changes the boot sector of the FAT partition it 
        resizes. OS/2 (if installed on a DOS partition) keeps a copy of the
        boot sector in a file, in order to use it as an alternative boot 
        sector for the dual boot utility. I haven't tested this myself, but
        I've got this report from other users. DO NOT resize your bootable
        FAT partition (drive C:) if you have OS/2 installed in a FAT partition
        of your system and you don't completely understand this situation, or
	don't know how to correct this afterwards.
Multitasking Environments:
        It's *really* dangerous to run Partition Resizer from any operating 
        system other than DOS. This means you should never run Partition 
        Resizer under Windows, Windows NT, OS/2, Linux (or Linux's DosEmu).
Secure File System (v.1.0):
        This program behaves strangely after a resizing. Either don't resize
        your partitions or remove it. 
Windows NT partitions:
        If moved, Windows NT partitions will not boot. I don't know if 
        anything worse can happen to your data, so don't move them...
Windows 3.1x Swapfile:
        If a partition containing a Windows 3.xx swapfile is moved or resized,
        the swapfile will corrupt. Remove swapfile before (to make more space 
        available, therefore make resizing faster) and make a new one after 
        resizing the partition.
Programs using BIOS alarm:
        Disable ANY program using BIOS alarm (could be any scheduling or alarm
        resident program or driver) before running Partition Resizer, 
        otherwise reset protection mechanism will not work.

As you understand, it's impossible to test Partition Resizer with every 
existing program or device driver, therefore you should be carefull not to
use Partition Resizer while running device drivers or programs that are not
absolutely required for your system to work. If you find any software problem
or conflict that is caused by Partition Resizer, please inform me ASAP (you
will find my address at the end of PRESIZER.DOC file).

Known and tested compatibility of Partition Resizer with other software
=======================================================================

Compression Drivers (Stacker, DoubleSpace, DriveSpace):
	The above listed drivers are compatible with Partition Resizer, since
	Partition Resizer ignores compressed drives.
OnTrack Disk Manager:
	Partition Resizer is fully compatible with OnTrack Disk Manager, but 
	the driver must be loaded, otherwise Partition Resizer will report
	an error (the best thing you can do though, is to get rid of this 
	driver ASAP; buy a new BIOS for god's shake!).
Windows 95, 95 OSR2, 98, 98 SR2:
	Partition Resizer is fully compatible with Windows 95 (this doesn't
	mean you can run Partition Resizer UNDER Windows 95; you must exit
	to DOS or Windows 95 real mode first).
Windows NT Boot Manager, LILO:
	You will not face any problems with these boot managers, but you
	have to reinstall them after you run Partition Resizer, in order
	to import the changes.
OS/2 Boot Manager:
	You will have to reinstall the boot manager (using the setup disks
	and OS/2's FDISK program) right after running Partition Resizer.
